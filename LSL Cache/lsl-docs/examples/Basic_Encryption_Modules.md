I have posted 3 sections to this code, the encryption, decryption, and also a 3rd file. While the 3rd is unnecessary, since the value for the next channel to communicate on is changed each time data is sent, i found it annoying that when you edited the code to change the number, or tweak minor things, when it was saved, it reloaded the default values. The third script does nothing more than store the next channel to communicate on and pass it to either the encrypter or decypter when that script is reset. If you choose to use it, it should be placed in both prims that you are using.

This code basically takes a float, converts it to an alpha key, randomizes it, than takes a random channel, converts it to an alpha key, randomizes it, appends it to the string for the float, and shouts it to another prim, which decrypts it and returns the value of the float, as well as change it's listen to the next randomly determined channel. In this incarnation the script is not practical for transferring data, however can be incorporated into your code to do so.

Thank you to whomever took the time to clean it up for easier viewing and made the changes :)

//WARNING!!!   Before actually using this to transfer any numbers(the principal is the same for strings)
//CHANGE THE ORDER OF THE LETTERS! - don't leave them sequential (a,b,c, etc.)
//it might even be a good idea to perform a simple math function on your number before you send it,
//(before encrypting it obviously). This is not practical for any use by itself, but i present it here
//for those that wish to customize it for their own needs (change the list in the Decrypter to match
