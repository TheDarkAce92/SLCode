Updates settings for a character

## Caveats

(subject to change)

- CHARACTER_DESIRED_SPEED ranges from 0.2 to 40.0.
- CHARACTER_RADIUS ranges from 0.1 to 5.0.
- CHARACTER_LENGTH ranges from 0.0 to 10.0.
- TRAVERSAL_TYPE_SLOW | TRAVERSAL_TYPE_FAST | TRAVERSAL_TYPE_NONE - only use one of these parameters or omit. Defaults to TRAVERSAL_TYPE_NONE to if omitted. This affects whether a character moving on terrain that is less than 100% walkable will move faster (e.g., a cat crossing a street) or slower (e.g., a car driving in a swamp).
- CHARACTER_TYPE_A | CHARACTER_TYPE_B | CHARACTER_TYPE_C | CHARACTER_TYPE_D | CHARACTER_TYPE_NONE - only use one of these parameters or omit. Defaults to CHARACTER_TYPE_NONE if omitted. This determines which of the 4 walkability coefficients the character pays attention to.
- The character's shape is a capsule (cylinder with spherical ends) with a length (from tip to tip) and a circular cross section of some radius. These two size parameters are what is controlled by the CHARACTER_LENGTH and CHARACTER_RADIUS params respectively.
- Note that the characters true "length" cannot be smaller than twice the radius however you're welcome to specify a value lower than that (but more than zero) -- the script shouldn't complain.
- The capsule is usually oriented vertically. It is possible to make the capsule lie horizontal by using an object that is long in its local X-axis, however these characters might not be able to navigate through gaps that cannot fit them lengthwise.

  - Use a vertical capsule whenever possible; horizontal capsules may become stuck more easily than vertical capsules.
- Removing the script from a prim will not stop pathing behavior, in the same way that particles and hover text remain. To stop a pathing command use `llExecCharacterCmd(CHARACTER_CMD_STOP, [])`.

## Examples

```lsl
default
{
    state_entry()
    {
        llCreateCharacter([CHARACTER_DESIRED_SPEED, 10.0]);

        list points = [llGetPos() + <5,0,0>, llGetPos() - <5,0,0>];
        llPatrolPoints(points, []);
    }

    touch_start(integer total_number)
    {
        llUpdateCharacter([CHARACTER_DESIRED_SPEED, 50.0]);
    }
}
```
