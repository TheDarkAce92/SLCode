This script is based on an extract from the Batman Follower v1.2.  It is very basic.  If you put it in an object, that object will keep moving toward a position *offset* from it's owner.

```lsl
vector offset = < -1, 0, 1>;  //1 meter behind and 1 meter above owner's center.

default
{
    state_entry()
    {
        llSetStatus(STATUS_PHYSICS, TRUE);
        // Little pause to allow server to make potentially large linked object physical.
        llSleep(0.1);
        // Look for owner within 20 metres in 360 degree arc every 1 seconds.
        llSensorRepeat("", llGetOwner(), AGENT, 20.0, PI,1.0);
    }
    sensor(integer total_number)
    {   // Owner detected...
        // Get position and rotation
        vector pos   = llDetectedPos(0);
        rotation rot = llDetectedRot(0);
        // Offset back one metre in X and up one metre in Z based on world coordinates.
        // use whatever offset you want.
        vector worldOffset = offset;
        // Offset relative to owner needs a quaternion.
        vector avOffset = offset * rot;

        pos += avOffset;       // use the one you want, world or relative to AV.

        llMoveToTarget(pos,0.4);
    }
}
```

```lsl
//adding this script as a less laggy and more efficient way of doing the same as above
//this is for havok4's new functions
vector offset = < -1, 0, 1>;  //1 meter behind and 1 meter above owner's center.

default
{
    state_entry()
    {
        llSetStatus(STATUS_PHYSICS, TRUE);
        // Little pause to allow server to make potentially large linked object physical.
        llSleep(0.1);
        llSetTimerEvent(1.0);
    }
    timer()
    {
        list det = llGetObjectDetails(llGetOwner(),[OBJECT_POS,OBJECT_ROT]);//this will never fail less owner is not in the same sim
        // Owner detected...
        // Get position and rotation
        vector pos   = llList2Vector(det,0);
        rotation rot = (rotation)llList2String(det,1);
        // Offset back one metre in X and up one metre in Z based on world coordinates.
        // use whatever offset you want.
        vector worldOffset = offset;
        // Offset relative to owner needs a quaternion.
        vector avOffset = offset * rot;

        pos += avOffset;       // use the one you want, world or relative to AV.

        llMoveToTarget(pos,0.4);
    }
}
```
